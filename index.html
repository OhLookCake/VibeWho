                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p> This is a cooperative game for two players (or teams). Player 1 secretly chooses one of the faces and Player 2 has to guess who it is. Player 2 should ask yes/no questions about the person Player 1 chose, but the questions must be based on vibes alone! </p>
                <p> For example, "Has your person ever been to a rave?", or "Does your person have their own podcast?". The more creative the questions, the more fun you'll have :)</p>
                <p> Any faces the Player 2 eliminates based on the answers can be 'closed' by clicking on them. </p>
                <p> The aim is to guess the person Player 1 chose in as few questions as possible, but really, the aim is to laugh at stereotypes and AI-generated faces.</p>
